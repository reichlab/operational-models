# AR2 model for influenza

# To run locally without Docker

To test this out locally, run the following with `flu_ar2` as your working directory.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py --today_date=2024-01-06
```

This should result in a model output file and a pdf with a plot under `flu_ar2/output/`.

# requirements.txt and renv.lock details

`requirements.txt` and `renv.lock` were generated according to [README.md](../README.md). For `renv.lock`, we installed these specific libraries:

```bash
Rscript -e "renv::install(c('lubridate', 'readr', 'remotes'))"
Rscript -e "renv::install('arrow')"
Rscript -e "renv::install('reichlab/zoltr')"
Rscript -e "renv::install('hubverse-org/hubData@*release')"
Rscript -e "renv::install('hubverse-org/hubVis@*release')"
```
